                <p> The COMPASS Workshops are a series of free, open-source statistical programming and data science workshops 
                held weekly during the academic year at Princeton University. Supported by the 
                <a href="https://sociology.princeton.edu/">Department of Sociology</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/politics/">Department of Politics</a>, and the 
                <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/president/eisgruber/who/eisgruber/">Office of the President</a>, 
                the workshops focus on using R with RStudio in a variety of real-world applications relevant to social scientists. Topics covered include data wrangling, 
                data visualization, Monte Carlo simulations, linear regression, social network analysis, and text mining. </p>
                
                <p> The COMPASS Workshops are held on <b>Tuesdays</b> from <b>7:30 to 9:00pm</b> in <b>Room 307 at the McGraw Teaching Center</b> 
                in the Frist Campus Center at Princeton University during the academic year. The workshops are open to all students, 
                staff, and affiliates of Princeton as well as the larger research community. To fully participate in the workshops 
                participants should bring a laptop, although a few laptops are available at the workshops. </p>
